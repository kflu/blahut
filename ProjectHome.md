# Description #
**Blahut algorithm** is an iterative computational way to estimate the channel capacity and the rate distortion. This implemetation of the Blahut algorithm uses the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL), mostly for the vector/matrix manipulations.

# Usage #
This software is provided as a library. If [gsl](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is properly installed, simply type `make` in the source directory will build the blahut.o, which can be linked against your own application, and a `main' example application. For more detail, read the document file (PDF) at [here](http://blahut.googlecode.com/files/doc.pdf)
